[Twiz.me](https://twiz.me) is tiny. It's a single purpose web tool.

<!-- e -->With Twiz you can create beaufitul twitter visuals in one click.<!-- /e -->

I wanted to have a one-click way to make twitter visuals from a screenshot. That's how Twiz was born.

The day I built it I decided to realease it publicly. For FREE. As it's a simple tool with no server component, I have basically no expenses on it. So why not.

People loved it. It got a lot of shares and likes on Twitter. A lot of people wrote me with ideas and suggestions (thank you all üôè).

But Twiz will stay simple forever. It won't get bloated with features, toggles and configurations.

**It's a tool, where you do your job and leave.**

Twiz is humble. And it works.
