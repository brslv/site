In the 1960s, legend has it, NASA spent millions on solving a problem.

Pens couldn't write in space.

The lack of gravity makes it impossible for the ink to flow down, thus making the pen unusable in outer space.

Russians, on the other hand, solved the problem without spending a dime.

They simply used pencils.

[Even though it's most probably fiction](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/), I find this story fascinating.

When "Ink doesn't work in outer space" turns into "We can't take notes in outer space" things suddenly become obvious.
