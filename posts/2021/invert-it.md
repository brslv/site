How do people build successful businesses?

This is something that I have been thinking a lot about lately. And the deeper I go, the more I realize it is not that straightforward.

Abstract problems of such scale require creativity.

For example, think about the opposite.

How do you fail at building a business? Now, this sounds obvious, right.

One way is to focus on efficiency rather than effectiveness. Another way is to ignore the market feedback loops. Or to have awful customer support.

Wait...ruining a business endeavor **can be distilled into a set of actions**.  ðŸ¤”

So could it be possible that if we try to avoid these actions, we could build a successful business?

According to [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger), it is.

This is a famous quote from him:

> "Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where donâ€™t we want to go, and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how to fail instead â€“ through sloth, envy, resentment, self-pity, entitlement, all the mental habits of self-defeat. Avoid these qualities and you will succeed. Tell me where Iâ€™m going to die, that is, so I donâ€™t go there."

It's not enough to think about a problem in one direction. We should strive to think in both directions - forward and backward.

This way of thinking leverages a principle (mental model), called "The Inversion Principle", popularized by the same guy - Charlie Munger.
