Whether something is productive or not depends on its context.

Take laying on your couch and doing nothing.

This sounds like a non-productive, time-wasting activity, doesn't it?

Well, it might be. If you've done zero meaningful work that day, then yeah, wasting even more time on your couch is not productive at all.

But if you've been working your ass off that day, laying on the couch for one or two hours and just chilling to some good music is far from unproductive activity.

In fact, it's exactly the opposite. It's a way for you to regain. To rest your body and mind.

It's a way to come back stronger.

It all boils down to a single principle, which I believe is a practical filter that we can easily apply to our daily activities.

> Productivity is everything that puts you in a better position for achieving your ultimate goal.

<!-- e -->The next time you feel guilty for spending time on your couch - don't.<!-- /e -->

Does this put you in a strategically better position in any way?

If so - do it. Guiltlessly.
